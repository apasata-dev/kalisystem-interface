# TagCreator - Smart Order Management

## Overview
TagCreator is a frontend-only React application designed for efficient order management. It provides a modern interface for handling items, categories, suppliers, and creating orders rapidly. The project aims to streamline order processing with features like quick order creation, item browsing, bulk ordering, and supplier management, all while persisting data locally and offering a responsive user experience with dark mode support.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development with clear explanations for any significant changes. Please ask before making major architectural decisions or refactoring large portions of the codebase. I value clean, readable code and prefer functional components in React. Do not make changes to files related to deployment configurations without explicit instruction.

## System Architecture
The application is a frontend-only React 18 application built with Vite and TypeScript. It leverages `shadcn-ui` components built on Radix UI primitives for a modern and accessible UI, styled with Tailwind CSS for custom theming and responsive design. `React Router v6` handles client-side routing, and state management is achieved using React Context API combined with TanStack Query for data fetching and caching. Data persistence is handled via browser `localStorage`.

**Key Features:**
- **Order Management:** Quick order creation with natural language parsing (item name and quantity), bulk ordering, and a detailed order workflow with status tracking (Hold, Pending, Processing, Received, Paid, Completed).
- **Item & Category Management:** Comprehensive item browsing, filtering, and management, including variant tags (Quantity, Supplier, Brand, Khmer Name) with distinct visual indicators. Categories can be grouped and filtered, with quick item creation functionalities.
- **Supplier Management:** Functionality to manage suppliers and associate them with items.
- **Data Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to store application data, with default data loaded from `public/default-data.json`.
- **UI/UX:** Dark mode support, mobile-responsive design with bottom navigation, and a focus on intuitive interfaces for efficient workflows. Gradient backgrounds are used for category tags, and various components like `QuantityInput`, `Checkbox`, and `Switch` enhance user interaction.
- **Validation:** Zod is used for data validation.

**Technical Implementations & Design Choices:**
- **Variant Tag System:** Items can have multiple variant tags (Quantity, Supplier, Brand, Khmer Name), each with a distinct color for visual identification. These are item-specific and displayed as colored badges.
- **Order Workflow Enhancements:** A detailed multi-stage order processing workflow (Hold, Pending, Processing, Received, Paid, Completed) with conditional button states and status badges.
- **Category Grouping & Filtering:** Items can be grouped by category with collapsible cards. Filter buttons allow toggling predefined category groups (Food, Beverages, Households).
- **Order Tagging:** Orders can be tagged with metadata like Order Type, Store, Payment Method, and Manager, which influence the order summary template.
- **Fuzzy Matching & Parsing:** Enhanced parsing logic (e.g., "Potato 2 kg") and Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matching improve quick order creation.
